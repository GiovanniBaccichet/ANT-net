<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

ANT-Net is a self deployable virtual infrastructure that hosts different services that are used in different courses at Politecnico di Milano. In particular it hosts:
- **VPN Gateway**: <img src="https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/blob/main/png/wireguard.png?raw=true" style="width:15px;"> [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) server w/ web interface for managing users and remote access to the infrastructure
- **MQTT Broker**: <img src="https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/blob/main/png/emqx.png?raw=true" style="width:15px;"> [EMQX](https://www.emqx.com/en) server with web interface for managing topics and clients
- **CoAP Server**: Python-based CoAP server
- **File Server + Sensor Network**: a RPi network sending wireless data to a centralized file management service

The diagram below shows the logical organization of the virtual infrastructure, and in particular how the network is segmented to prevent users from communicating with machines on the outside of the virtual lab network.

### Built With

The project is build around <img src="https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/blob/main/png/proxmox.png?raw=true" style="width:15px;"> [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/). The deployment of VMs is performed through <img src="https://www.terraform.io/img/logo.png" style="width:15px;"> [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), using the [Terraform Provider for Proxmox](https://github.com/bpg/terraform-provider-proxmox) (we tested it with version 0.65.0). Despite being very well documented, said provider lacks some features regarding Proxmox templating and networking, and for that reason I added the scripts in `scripts/`. Additionally, the VM configuration is performed with the scripts in `scripts/vm_configuration`, this since every configuration is very simple, and it would have been totally overkill to use a tool like Ansible.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The main goal of this project being a reproducible and easy-to-deploy setup, most of the configurations are automatic and require little to none user interaction.

### Prerequisites

To successfully deploy the infrastructure, ensure you meet the following requirements:

1. **Proxmox Server**  
   - A computer running <img src="https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons/blob/main/png/proxmox.png?raw=true" style="width:15px;"> [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/) (tested on version 8.2).  
   - Ensure that the server is connected to the internet and has at least one separate Network Interface Card (NIC).

2. **Network Interface Configuration**  
   - **Motherboard NIC**: Reserved for internet access and Proxmox management - will be `vmbr0`.  
   - **PCIe NIC**: Dedicated to the *VPN-Gateway* virtual machine. This NIC should be configured to be passed through to the VM and exposed publicly for VPN access.

3. **Additional Requirements**  
   - Sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, and storage) to run the Proxmox environment and the planned virtual machines - in the base config, at least 8 CPU cores and 16 GB RAM.  
   - Access to a computer or device with Terraform installed (<img src="https://www.terraform.io/img/logo.png" style="width:15px;"> [Terraform installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials)).  
   - SSH keys for secure access to Proxmox and other virtual machines will be configured in the next step.

4. **Terraform Environment**  
   - Terraform (version 1.9.8 or later, tested with version 1.9.8).  
   - The Terraform Proxmox provider configured. Install it via `terraform init` using the provided `proxmox` provider in this repo's `main.tf`.  


### Proxmox Authentication

The Terraform Proxmox provider uses API Token Key authentication. Before starting we need to create a user and generate an API token for that user (more info [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest/docs)). For this project, user creation, permissions, API Token generation and SSH keys are managed using `scripts/ssh_api_token_setup.sh`.

**It is mandatory to execute that script** - or generate manually a user, assign the correct permissions and generate an API Token - **before proceeding**. It will output the SSH keys, both public and private, in `ssh`, and will output in CLI the Proxmox API Token, which must be copied and will be used by Terraform as authentication.

Inside `terraform/terraform.tfvars` put the output of the script, it should be something like:

```
api_token = "terraform@pve!provider=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Installation

To deploy and configure the machine, ensure you have the following at hand:  
- **API Token** (generated in the previous step) 
- **Proxmox root password**  

Follow these steps: 

#### 1. Configure `variables.tf`
Edit the `terraform/variables.tf` file to include your configuration details, such as the Proxmox host's IP address and hostname. Below is an example of what the file might look like:

```hcl
variable "proxmox_host" {
  default = "HOSTNAME_HERE"
}

variable "proxmox_host_ip" {
  default = "10.79.5.250"
}

variable "api_url" {
  default = "https://10.79.5.250:8006/api2/json"
}
```

#### 2. Populate `terraform.tfvars`

Update the `terraform/terraform.tfvars` file with your API Token and Proxmox root password. This step is crucial as the [Terraform Provider for Proxmox](https://github.com/bpg/terraform-provider-proxmox) relies on both token-based and password-based authentication. Here's a template to guide you:

```hcl
api_token = "terraform@pve!provider=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
username = "root@pam"
password = "PASSWORD_HERE"
```

#### 3. Configure VM Password

> [!CAUTION]  
> The default credentials for VM templates are `antlab/antlab`. **Please ensure you change these for security reasons.**

> [!TIP]  
> We recommend changing each VM's password using the **Cloud-Init** tab in the Proxmox Web interface, after they are all configured. Assign a unique password to each VM for added security. Note that **SSH password authentication is disabled by default**, and all machines are behind a firewall.

To set the **default** username and password for the VM template, edit the `terraform/modules/vm-template/main.tf` file. Locate the following section:

```hcl
user_account {
  username = "antlab"
  keys     = [trimspace(data.local_file.ssh_public_key.content)]
  password = "antlab"
}
```

This block specifies:
- The **username** (antlab)
- The **password** (antlab)
- The **SSH keys**, which are automatically configured based on the script in the [Proxmox Authentication](#proxmox-authentication) section.

By customizing these fields, you ensure the VM template is configured with secure and unique credentials. 


#### 4. Initialize and Apply Terraform

Once the configuration files are updated, navigate to the `terraform/` directory and run the following commands to initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

This process will download and configure the provider, then deploy the configuration. Note: The deployment may take 15-20 minutes.

For convenience, you can use this one-liner:

```bash
terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve
```
